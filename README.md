# Pattern Printing Using C++

## What is this repository about?
This repository is a collection of solved problems on printing patterns using C++. It is subdivided into 4 categories,

- Patterns based on stars
- Patterns based on numbers
- Patterns based on alphabets
- Patterns based on mixture of stars, numbers and alphabets

Each category has its own README file which includes the patterns and the link to the code of that particular pattern. This avoids the need to open each file and figure out the pattern solved.

## Why this repository?
To develop logic as well as understand working of loops and implement them efficiently.
